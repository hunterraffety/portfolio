                endrsd seeks to bridge the gap between technical curriculum and
                career focused curriculum by solving the problem of of allowing
                students to track and monitor their progress through the career
                endorsement process independently. It also provides a career
                coach dashboard to monitor, track, and reach out to students.

                This full stack application was developed using React, Express
                and PostGres for the data provider. A fully-functional backend
                API was written to connect the front-end web application
                utilizing knex to the PostGres database to warehouse our
                information. I contributed to the front-end react application
                among a team of 3 engineers.
