        As a dedicated engineering leader with a relentless drive for
        excellence, I have consistently strived to elevate both my personal
        growth and the performance of my teams. My journey from a passionate
        Full Stack Engineer to an accomplished Engineering Manager has been
        marked by a commitment to fostering innovation, enhancing user
        experiences through deliverables, and driving strategic initiatives that
        align with business objectives.

      <p>
        With strong foundations in fundamnetals and a continually growing modern
        skill set with TypeScript, JavaScript, React, node.js, and AWS services,
        and people management skills, I have successfully led cross-functional
        teams to deliver intuivive user oriented features with high activation
        and usage metrics and while also optimizing user enrollment processes
        and versions for user testing that resulted in significant growth
        metrics. My leadership style, grounded in Radical Candor, emphasizes
        open communication, continuous learning, and empowering team members to
        achieve their fullest potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond an ever evolving and growing technical skill set, my passion for
        leadership, fostering growth, and strategic planning has enabled me to
        spearhead initiatives such as international expansion, accessibility
        compliance audits, and innovative feature development deliverables that
        not only enhance product offerings but also drive user engagement and
        satisfaction. I am committed to leveraging my skills and experiences to
        contribute meaningfully to forward-thinking organizations, continuously
        pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve together.
