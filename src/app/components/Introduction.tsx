        As a dedicated engineering leader with a relentless drive for
        excellence, I have consistently strived to elevate both my personal
        growth and the performance of my teams. My journey from a passionate
        Full Stack Engineer to an accomplished Engineering Manager has been
        marked by a commitment to fostering innovation, enhancing user
        experiences through deliverables, and driving strategic initiatives that
        align with business objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        With strong foundations in programming and a strong drive to work with
        people, supported by a continually growing modern skillset with
        TypeScript and JavaScript, React, node.js, AWS, and people management
        skills, I have been able to successfully lead cross-functional teams to
        achieve high quality deliverables on time and with a focus on avoiding
        and minimizing negative user and company outcomes or critical incidents
        resulting in outages or down time.
        <br />
        <br />
        My leadership approach, rooted in Radical Candor, prioritizes
        transparent communication, fosters continuous learning, and empowers
        team members to reach their full potential. By cultivating an
        environment of trust and open dialogue, I ensure that each team member
        feels valued and supported, enabling us to collaborate effectively and
        achieve our collective goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond an ever evolving and growing technical skill set, my passion for
        leadership, fostering growth, and strategic planning has enabled me to
        spearhead initiatives such as international expansion, accessibility
        compliance audits, and innovative feature development deliverables that
        not only enhance product offerings but also drive user engagement and
        satisfaction. I am committed to leveraging my skills and experiences to
        contribute meaningfully to forward-thinking organizations, continuously
        pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve together.
